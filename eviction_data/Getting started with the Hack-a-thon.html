<span><div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why eviction matters</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="https://evictionlab.org/why-eviction-matters/#understanding-eviction">Why is it important to study and understand eviction?</a></div><div style="margin-left: 80px;"><span style="-en-paragraph:true;">The lack of affordable housing sits at the root of a host of social problems, from poverty and homelessness to educational disparities and health care. That means understanding the eviction crisis is critical to effectively addressing these problems and reducing inequality. However, before the launch of the Eviction Lab dataset, little was known about the prevalence of eviction in America, so studying its causes and consequences on a national level was impossible. This new dataset gives us the tools to better understand—and fight—America’s eviction epidemic.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="https://evictionlab.org/why-eviction-matters/#eviction-impact">How does an eviction affect someone’s life?</a></div><div style="margin-left: 80px;"><span style="-en-paragraph:true;">Eviction causes a family to lose their home. They often are also expelled from their community and their children have to switch schools. Families regularly lose their possessions, too, which are piled on the sidewalk or placed in storage, only to be reclaimed after paying a fee. A legal eviction comes with a court record, which can prevent families from relocating to decent housing in a safe neighborhood, because many landlords screen for recent evictions. Studies also show that eviction causes job loss, as the stressful and drawn-out process of being forcibly expelled from a home causes people to make mistakes at work and lose their job. Eviction also has been shown to affect people's mental health: one study found that mothers who experienced eviction reported higher rates of depression two years after their move. The evidence strongly indicates that eviction is not just a condition of poverty, it is a cause of it.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="https://evictionlab.org/why-eviction-matters/#affordable-housing-crisis">What is the relationship between the affordable housing crisis and the eviction epidemic?</a></div><div style="margin-left: 80px;"><span style="-en-paragraph:true;">Today, most poor renting families spend at least half of their income on housing costs, with one in four of those families spending over 70 percent of their income just on rent and utilities. Incomes for Americans of modest means have flatlined while housing costs have soared. Only one in four families who qualifies for affordable housing programs gets any kind of help. Under those conditions, it has become harder for low-income families to keep up with rent and utility costs, and a growing number are living one misstep or emergency away from eviction.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;-en-paragraph:true;">Back Story | </span><span style="-en-paragraph:true;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why is it worth studying Peoria's Eviction rates?</span></span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Hi, my name's Andrew Agostini and I started working for the community development department this past March, 2019. A few weeks into the job a stumbled upon a site called <a href="https://evictionlab.org/">EvictionLab.org</a> which explores the relationship between eviction and poverty across the US. While perusing the site I came across something a bit shocking: </div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: center; margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">At 3.45 evictions per 100 renter homes, Peoria had the</span> <a href="https://evictionlab.org/rankings/#/evictions?r=United%20States&amp;a=0&amp;d=evictionRate&amp;l=84" style="font-style: italic;">85th highest eviction rate</a><span style="font-style: italic;"> of large US cities in 2016.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br/></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;">That's a total of 727 Evictions in 2016, or about 2 households evicted every day. When I first read those numbers I was taken aback. I couldn't recall a local politician or newspaper interested in the subject. So I began looking through city and county data to see if it could be true that our eviction rates were as bad as Eviction Lab said they were.</div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br/></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;">First I looked at the Sheriff's schedule to see how many police assisted evictions were taking place. There were two evictions schedule the day prior, that day, and the next day. Interesting, there's a coincidence: The sheriff has 2 household evictions scheduled per day, three days in a row, and the folks from Eviction Lab say that there are about 2 households evicted per day. </div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br/></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;">That was coincidence enough that next I wanted to see what the official court record data had to say. Since the county is responsible for hearing eviction cases, I worked with them to get that data. So I made a field trip to the county Clerk's office and explained my little eviction project. It was then when one of the helpers behind the desk said:</div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: center; margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">&quot;Evictions? That's most of our work&quot;</span></div><div style="text-align: center; margin-left: 40px;"><br/></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;">That is to say, most of the circuit clerk's data entry is for eviction related cases so then thought I must be on to something. But, as it turns out, the software that the county uses (which is called Odyssey) let's you search individual case files but doesn't allow you to bulk export them for analysis. So the only thing I walked away with that day were filing summaries. After plotting the number here's what I saw:</div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: center; margin-left: 40px;"><img src="Getting started with the Hack-a-thon_files/Image.png" type="image/png" data-filename="Image.png"/><img src="Getting started with the Hack-a-thon_files/Image [1].png" type="image/png" data-filename="Image.png"/></div><div style="text-align: center; margin-left: 40px;">(source the Peoria County Circuit Clerk)</div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br/></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;">According to Eviction Lab, there were &quot;a total of 727 Evictions in 2016.&quot; Up top we're reading there were <span style="font-style: italic;">1,487 eviction related cases...</span> which is a little different<span style="font-style: italic;">.</span> I'm still not sure what the difference is but two things could be at play</div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br/></div><ol><li><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Eviction Lab under counted the true number of evictions in Peoria, or, more likely</div></li><li><div style="margin-left: 40px;">A case as viewed by the county clerk's system is representative of an individual party. So there could be something like &quot;two case records&quot; for every eviction, one for the defendant and the other for the plaintiff. This theory is backed up by the fact that if you divide 1487 by 2 you get 744 which is pretty close to 727.</div></li></ol><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br/></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Next I had to work with one of the county's IT programmers to access the county court records in bulk, <span style="font-style: italic;">a la SQL. </span>This actually wasn't that easy because the backend's data structure was so complicated that the county programmer would have to rely on the original vendor (Tyler Technologies) to code something special for us. We got lucky and instead of this taking &quot;forever&quot; I got the data a few weeks later.</div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br/></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Today, you enter the story.</div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br/></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;">In the folder provided to you for this hackathon you are given the county court eviction data I collected. With your help, we can paint a more accurate picture of the eviction problem in Peoria. Only once we better understand this data, and the stories of those affected, can we take steps toward curbing eviction driven homelessness in Peoria. </div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">What's in the folder?</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;">There are two sub-folders in the provided folder.

Only  a few other stats have been calculated in there too.</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">What's there to do?</span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;">I want to keep this open ended. There's a lot of data that isn't mapped or analyzed (for example, there are 253 columns in <img src="Getting started with the Hack-a-thon_files/Image [20].png" type="image/png" data-filename="Image.png"/> and only about 5 are used). At the end of the day we'd just like to better understand the evictions happening in our own community and to ultimately think of ways to reduce them. We'd love to see what you come up with. </div></div><div><br/></div></span>
